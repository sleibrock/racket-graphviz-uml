A Graphviz UML free code generator

Generate Graphviz UML models from your code
Heavily Work-In-Progress


CONCEPT
---
Convert a code expression into a UML diagram that
can be followed as if it were laid out manually,
removing the need to design UML first, code later.
You can now code first, then have UML documentation
later.

---
Convert the expressions into graph form

(if (= x 5)
    (displayln "is true")
    (displayln "isn't true"))

digraph {
         "if (= x 5)" -> "(displayln "is true")"
         "if (= x 5)" -> "(displayln "isn't true")"
}

---

(cond
  ([= x 5] 3)
  (else    4))

digraph {
         "cond" -> "(= x 5)"
         "cond" -> "else"
         "(= x 5)" -> "3"
         "else" -> "4"
}

---

(case x
  ((a b c) 4)
  (else    0))

digraph {
         "case" -> "(a b c)"
         "case" -> "else"
         "(a b c)" -> "4"
         "else" -> 0
}


The program should be able to mimic these basic flows, as well
as conditionals like `when` and `unless`, which are easy
to implement from the same flow as `if`


Multiple sections of code (aka a sequence of code) like a `begin`
sequence should be connected properly.
If a `when` happens before an `if`, then the result of the `when`
should connect to the following `if` body, and so on and so forth,
exactly as it would with Racket code.


There will be at least 5 rules for code here to render.
* if
* cond
* case
* when
* unless

Since code can look similar in many places, we need to bind
IDs to each code datum using `gensym` to generate IDs on the fly.
This will be used to build our virtual graph traversal structure

;; A sequence of code is different.
;; A sequence is a linear list of actions to take, which may not have
;; any impact on other functions in the sequence, but are still executed
;; in a linear first-in-first-out fashion.
;; A sequence is like `begin`, where results are stored, but discarded
;; per each execution, if not bound locally via let.
;;
;; Example:
;; ```
;; (begin
;;  (displayln hello)
;;  (+ 1 2 3))
;; ```
;; While displayln returns void, it's result is not connected to
;; the + call, but displayln occurs before +, so in that sense,
;; the "flow" is displayln first, then +, meaning displayln
;; connects to +
;;
;; To parse this, we must iterate over all expressions in a sequence
;; and link the final outputs of each code piece to the next sequence
;; by using the #:next-section hidden variable in parse-code.
;; parse-code will use #:next-section when it's at the bottom of an
;; expression tree to connect to the next sequence.
